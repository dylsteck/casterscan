### What is Casterscan?

Casterscan is a block explorer for Farcaster. It lets you view and query all casts & profiles, view channels, and see raw metadata you would otherwise have to run code to get. Casterscan is built using [Farcaster Kit](https://farcasterkit.com), free React hooks and an API to easily build Farcaster apps.

There are two goals for Casterscan's utility:
- make it easy to access/query Farcaster data
- give each atomic unit of data available on [Hubs](https://www.thehubble.xyz/) its own URL, starting with casts and profiles


### How to run locally
1. `npm install`
2. (optional) add your base URL to `<FarcasterKitProvider>` if you're running the [Farcaster Kit API](https://github.com/dylsteck/farcasterkit/tree/main/apps/api) locally
3. `npm run dev` and you're good to go!
